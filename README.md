Speech-Recognition
==================

Accesses your microphone and using the speech recognition user-agent built service, it produces a speech-to-text output!

Note: Web Speech is not yet on Chrome release (it will be out on May) for now download and use Google chrome canary! <br>
Note: Because of the 'same origin policy' you have to run index.html behind a web server. Just use a simple python http server
